I am an Associate Research Professor in Fluids mechanics in the laboratory [LAMPS](https://lamps.univ-perp.fr/).
I am interested in the numerical simulation of multi-scale incompressible flows which require important computation ressources.
I try to bring together accurate discretizations with modern high-performance computing...

## Research interests:
* Fluid mechanics
* High Performance Computing
* Granular media
* Baroclinic instabiliti

## Research: Computational Fluid Dynamics, Compressible flows of ideal and real gases, data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification of turbulent flows.

## Education

**2001** : School of engineering (Master degree ) in  * Energy and Process Engineerings *, Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Poitiers

**2002** : DEA (Master of Science) in Computational Fluid Dynamic, Ecole Centrale Nantes

**2005** : PhD in ‘Fluid Mechanics' at Ecole des Mines de Nantes

**2022** : Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches, Université Perpignan Via Domitia

## Professional experience

**2005-2006**: Postdoc at Université de Nantes and Centre de Calcul Intensive des Pays de la Loire,  *Nantes*

**2006-2008**: Research Engineer, Commisariat à l'Energie Atomique / CSGroup, *Saclay*

**2008-date**: Associate professor, Université Perpignan Via Domitia/LAMPS, *Perpignan* 

## Some recent responsibilities

**2021-date**  Coordinator  of the  Master-1 *High Performance Computing & Simulation*

**2020-date**  Second Deputy head of the Users' Disciplinary Section

**2020-2022** Member of the Research Council at Université de Perpignan
a
**2020-2022** Member of the IUT Council

**2019-2021** Responsable projets de synthèse puis stages du M2-CHPS -UFR SEE-,

**2014-2022** Nominated laboratory board member of LAMPS

# Teaching

Principal teacher of several courses in fluid mechanics (Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, Hydraulics, Aerodynamics, Gasdynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Turbulence, Turbulence modelling),
applied mathematics (Numerical Analysis, Fundamentals of Statistics, Calculus, Uncertainty Quantification) and energetics (Thermal Power Systems, Renewable Energies)
since 2001 (more than 4000 hours of teaching experience, Bachelor, Master of Engineering, Master of Science and Doctoral levels). Most of my courses are taught in French and in English.
In the past, I also gave courses in Italian and Spanish.
